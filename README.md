# And the meek shall inherit the Earth!
# Rush 2112 1975

If you have ever listened to the 2002 Album Vapor Trails by Rush, you will be blown away!

Peaceable Kingdom 
Vapor Trails
One Little Victory
Nocturne
Out of the Cradle
and the one that hits home for me, Freeze (Part IV or 'Fear')

Back to the ReadMe file.  Please read the lyrics to Freeze, and for the combat veterans out there, it will hit home

Thanks,

Dave
